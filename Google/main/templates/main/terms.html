    <p>Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.</p>
    <p>Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export and delete your information.</p>
